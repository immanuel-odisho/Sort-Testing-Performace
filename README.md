# Sort-Testing-Performace
This program takes different input arrays spanning from 16 to 16384 elements and runs an analysis to determine the speed time to sort each of the arrays with different sorting algorithms. The different sorting algorithms include Heap sort, Merge sort, Insertion Sort and Insertion sort with Binary search. The sorting algorithms also implement the comparable interface.
